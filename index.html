    This is where you write about your experience. Do not simply list your
    day-to-day job duties. Work in
        resume keywords
    that are most relevant to the job for which you’re applying. Try replacing
    some of your duties with measurable results and accomplishments rather than
    duties. Remember, “duties tell, accomplishments sell.” To create a strong
    measurable result, try this format: [Action verb] [brief explanation of
    accomplishment] resulting in [quantifiable outcome. Using %, $, etc. will
    draw the eye and make an impact]. For example: “Responded to an average of
    203 customer service emails per week, improving response time by 74% and
    customer satisfaction by 31% between 2016 to 2017.”

    Keep your sentences short and to the point. This will make it easier for a
    recruiter or hiring manager to read or skim. Use your limited space to
    focus on things are that most relevant to the new job, rather than going
    into every detail about the responsibilities that took up most of your
    time. Tailor your resume to the job description.

    short and to the point, but you can go a little long in the functional

    context to it.
</p>
<p>
    ● <strong>Skill 3</strong> - For example (hard skills):
</p>
<p>
    ● <strong>Forklift Operation</strong> - OSHA certified forklift operator
    with 5+ years of experience and a perfect safety record
</p>
<p>
    ● <strong>Skill 5</strong> - Another example (soft skills):

    ➢ At the executive level, little attention should be paid to your
    day-to-day duties, work habits, or even hard skills.
</p>
<p>
    ○ Instead, it’s all about results and impact.
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Under your leadership, what was the business able to achieve?
</p>
<p>
    ○ What were your biggest initiatives? What bold moves did you make improve
    the company’s standing? How much did the business grow while you were in
    the position?
</p>
<p>
    ➢Learn more about creating powerful, concise executive accomplishments
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Numbers and results. Executive recruiters need to know you’re going to
    move the needle
</p>
<p>
    ○ For example: “Added $32M in new profit over 3 years by developing
    differentiated product line which decreased service time 50% for end

    ➢ When applying for executive positions, you can’t lean on your hard skills
    as much as you did earlier in your career.

        Executive soft skills
    take on greater significance.
</p>
<p>
    ○ Unfortunately, you can’t just <em>say</em> you have leadership and expect
    executive recruiters to believe you. You have to find a way to prove it.
    For example:
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Leadership: Ask yourself, what situations benefited the most from your
    timely leadership?
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Vision: When you mention your big ideas, initiatives, and
    accomplishments, demonstrate your vision by including the why and placing
    them in context of the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Entrepreneurial: Think back to any pet projects you nurtured, departments
    you grew, or calculated risks that paid off big.
</p>
<p>
    ➢ I nnovation: Compile the best examples and stories from your past
    experience in which you changed operating procedure, streamlined processes,
    consolidated systems, or mined a previously untapped sector of the market.

    ➢ Typically, we advise to keep your resume to one page, but if you’ve been
    at it long enough to reach the C-suite -- particularly if it’s been 10+
    years -- you deserve another page or two.
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Don’t worry too much about expanding beyond a single page as you show
    your career trajectory. That said, make sure to put your most important
    information and achievements on page one.
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Use short bullet points and strong accomplishments to keep your
    experience powerful and to-the-point.

    ➢ Your executive brand is important to executive recruiters. “I don’t care
    if it goes back 15 or 30 years,” an executive recruiter told Jobscan
    . “I just want to see that the resume is promoting a highly competent,
    proven executive who knows what they’re best at, where they want to go, and
    what they really want to do next in their career.”
</p>
<p>
    ➢ Find opportunities to show not only the end results, but how you identify
    opportunities and achieve results
</p>
<p>
    ➢ If possible, communicate your business values. Give the recruiter an idea
    of what you’ll want to accomplish first at this new job based on what
    you’re sharing about your previous jobs.

    ➢ “What have you done for me lately?” You don’t need to include your entire
    career on your resume. If something is 15 or more years old, think hard
    about whether it adds to your candidacy or not, especially if age discrimination is a concern.

    This is where you write about your experience. Do not simply list your
    day-to-day job duties. Work in resume keywords that are most relevant to the job for which you’re applying. Provide
    context to the skills and accomplishments above.

    <strong>Company 3</strong>
    , Location
</p>
<p>
    <em>Job Title,</em>
    (MM/YYYY)-(MM/YYYY)
</p>
<p>
    Because you listed skills and accomplishments above using this hybrid
    format, you can afford to write a little bit less in your experience
    section. Expand to two pages if necessary, but keeping your resume to one
    page is a good goal to have (unless you have over 10-15 years of relevant
    experience).

    <strong>Company 2</strong>
    , Location
</p>
<p>
    <em>Job Title,</em>
    (MM/YYYY)-(MM/YYYY)
</p>
<p>
    It’s OK to leave positions off your resume if they aren’t relevant to the
    job you’re pursuing. Unless the experience is crucial, you can also go into
    fewer details on older positions.

  <h2>The Do's and Dont's of Resume Writing</h2>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Do's</h3><br>
  <ul>
	  <li>Within each section, you must list experiences in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent.</li>
	<li>Qualify and quantify your experiences whenever possible. Include numbers and percentages when possible.</li>
	<li>Highlight specific accomplishments rather than expand on every detail.</li>
	<li>Expand on professional, volunteer, research, and classroom experiences to show transferable skills.</li>
	<li>Proofread your work. Ask the Career Center, friends, and advisors for help.</li>
	<li>List the most important, relevant items first. For example, you may decide to move your “Internships” and “Projects” sections above your “Customer Service Experience” section. Underneath each experience, you should also put the most important bullet points first.</li>
</ul><br>
  <h3>Don'ts</h3><br>
  <ul>
  	<li>Use templates and tables included in software.</li>
	  	<li>Make general claims (“Good communication skills”) without backing them up with examples.</li>
	<li>Mislead employers about your GPA, skills, or abilities.</li>
	<li>Include long, generic objective statements. Employers won’t read them!</li>
	<li>Submit references on the same page as your resume. They should be kept in a separate document and provided when the employer asks for them.</li>

  <h2>Why Cover Letters Are Important
</h2>
  <br><br>
   <p>
	  	<b>A cover letter is more than just a formality or courtesy – it is an opportunity to impress. Research suggests that employers favor resumes that are accompanied by a cover letter, making it a critical component of your job-search strategy.<br><br></b>
	  	A well-written cover letter is an opportunity to show the reader your:<br><br>
			<li><b>Immediate Value<br></b></li>
			First impressions count. A concise and compelling cover letter is your first chance to stand out and be considered a strong candidate amongst tough competition. Immediately emphasizing your key strengths will help ‘sell you,’ grabbing the reader’s attention and increasing the likelihood of progression through the selection process.<br><br>
			<li><b>Unique Fit<br></b></li>
			A cover letter is an important way to showcase how your unique combination of skills and experience meet the key requirements of the job description. It is your chance to show a clear link between your knowledge, experience and abilities and the needs of the employer.<br><br>
			<li><b>Personality<br></b></li>
			The wording of your cover letter can express your personality in a way that your resume cannot. The tone of your letter gives the employer an important insight into your personality and the kind of traits that could add value to their team. It allows you to explain in your own words why you are the best person for the job.<br><br>
			<li><b>Enthusiasm<br></b></li>
			A tailored, compelling cover letter shows you have taken the time to research the company and understand the employer’s needs and job requirements. It is an opportunity to express that you are enthusiastic about the role and to demonstrate the value you would add to the employer.
			For help writing an impressive cover letter, contact a Michael Page recruitment consultant or check out these helpful tips on how to write a cover letter.
